## Introduction

- This project explores the Recipes and Ratings dataset from Food.com, which contains tens of thousands of user-submitted recipes along with nutrition facts and review scores.
- Question: Do healthier recipes get higher ratings?
- This question is important because it explores if user preferences align with nutrition. If healthier recipes tend to receive higher ratings, it could reflect a growing interest in wellness and clean eating. If not, it may suggest that taste, indulgence, or convenience outweigh nutrition based on users evaluation of recipes. These insights could be valuable for food platforms, recipe developers, and health-focused recommendation systems.
